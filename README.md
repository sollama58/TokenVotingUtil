# ASDelegate

A Solana token lock verifier and governance platform built on the [Streamflow](https://streamflow.finance/) protocol. Displays all locked/vesting token contracts for a configurable SPL token mint, with a built-in proposal and voting system weighted by token holdings.

## Features

- **Lock Dashboard** — Summary cards showing total locked tokens, active locks, next unlock date, and more
- **Lock Browser** — Sortable/filterable table of every individual lock contract with detailed modals
- **Unlock Timeline** — Interactive Chart.js graph of upcoming unlock events across all locks
- **Wallet Integration** — Connect Phantom, Solflare, or any Solana wallet to see your locks and token balance
- **My Tokens** — Modal showing wallet balance, locked tokens, total holdings, and voting power shares
- **Proposals & Voting** — Create proposals and vote with two modes:
  - **Locked Only** — Voting power = currently locked tokens
  - **All Holders** — Voting power = wallet balance + tokens in lock contracts (allows any token holder to vote)
- **Vote Thresholds** — Proposals pass when the margin between the leading choice and runner-up exceeds a configurable percentage of total available votes
- **Lock Naming** — Lock senders/recipients can rename their locks; admins can rename any lock
- **Admin Panel** — Password-protected panel to manage proposals, votes, lock names, and force data refreshes
- **Server-Side Caching** — PostgreSQL-backed cache with in-memory layer to avoid Solana RPC rate limits
- **Embeddable** — CORS and CSP configured for iframe embedding on any website (e.g., Squarespace)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL (`pg`)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (single `public/index.html`), Chart.js
- **Blockchain**: `@streamflow/stream` for lock data, `@solana/web3.js` and `@solana/spl-token` for wallet balance and token supply queries
- **Hosting**: Designed for [Render](https://render.com/) (free tier compatible)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18
- PostgreSQL database (local or hosted)

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Configure

Copy the example environment file and edit it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Run

```bash
# Development (auto-reload on file changes)
npm run dev

# Production
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SOLANA_RPC_URL` | `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com` | Solana RPC endpoint. Use a dedicated provider (Helius, QuickNode, etc.) for production. |
| `TOKEN_MINT` | `9zB5wRarXMj86MymwLumSKA1Dx35zPqqKfcZtK1Spump` | SPL token mint address to track. Change this to monitor a different token. |
| `TOKEN_DECIMALS` | `6` | Decimal places for the token mint. |
| `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `300` | How often (in seconds) lock data is refreshed from Streamflow. |
| `PORT` | `3000` | HTTP port. Render sets this automatically. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | — | PostgreSQL connection string. Required. Example: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/lockverifier` |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | — | Password for the admin panel. Leave empty to disable the admin panel entirely. |
| `SITE_TITLE` | `ASDelegate` | Site title displayed in the header and browser tab. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173` | Comma-separated list of origins allowed to embed this app via iframe. Configure for production. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | Winston log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379` | Redis connection string for distributed rate limiting. Falls back to in-memory if unavailable. |

## Deploy to Render

Render can provision everything automatically from the included `render.yaml` blueprint:

1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. In the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/), click **New > Blueprint**
3. Connect your GitHub repo — Render reads `render.yaml` and creates the web service + PostgreSQL database
4. In the Render **Environment** tab, set these secrets:
   - `SOLANA_RPC_URL` — A dedicated Solana RPC endpoint (the public one has strict rate limits)
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` — A strong password for the admin panel
5. Render automatically sets `DATABASE_URL` from the provisioned database
6. Deploy — the app will be live at `https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com`

### Manual Deploy (Any Platform)

1. Provision a PostgreSQL database
2. Set all environment variables (see table above)
3. Run `npm install && npm start`
4. The app creates its database tables automatically on first startup

### Redis Rate Limiting

The app uses Redis for distributed rate limiting (shared across multiple instances).

- **Production**: Requires a Redis instance. Render provides a Redis addon in the dashboard.
- **Development**: Falls back to in-memory rate limiting if Redis is unavailable.
- **Configuration**: Set `REDIS_URL` env var to your Redis connection string.

If Redis is not available and you're in production, rate limiting will still work (in-memory fallback), but will reset on app restart.

### Structured Logging

The app uses Winston for structured logging with multiple outputs:

- **Development**: Console output with colors for readability
- **Production**: Console + file logging (JSON format) to `logs/error.log` and `logs/combined.log`
- **Configuration**: Set `LOG_LEVEL` env var (`debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`). Default is `info`.

**Important**: In production, ensure the `logs/` directory exists and is writable. On Render, this is handled automatically by the build script.

### CORS and Iframe Embedding

The app uses CORS and Content-Security-Policy to control iframe embedding:

- **ALLOWED_ORIGINS**: Comma-separated list of domains that can embed the app
- **Default** (development): `http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173`
- **Production**: Set explicitly in your hosting platform (e.g., Render env vars)

Example for embedding on `mysite.com`:
```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://mysite.com,https://mysite.com
```

## Embed in Squarespace (or Any Website)

Add a **Code Block** (or raw HTML block) with:

```html
<iframe
  src="https://your-service-name.onrender.com"
  width="100%" height="900" frameborder="0"
  style="border:none;border-radius:12px;"
  loading="lazy" title="ASDelegate">
</iframe>
```

The server restricts iframe embedding to origins in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var via CSP and CORS headers. Set this to your embedding domains in production.

## Voting System

- **Locked mode**: Voting power = sum of currently locked tokens across the voter's lock contracts
- **All Holders mode**: Voting power = wallet SPL token balance + tokens still in lock contracts (totalAmount − withdrawn)
- Votes are **final** — once cast, they cannot be changed
- Threshold is the minimum margin (as a % of total available votes) between the leading choice and runner-up for a proposal to pass
- Only wallets with voting power > 0 can vote
